__Note that:__ If you want to run the code you need to start from the `RQ1.ipynb` in order to create a pickle file you'll need to run the `RQ2.ipynb`

## Collection of files:

1. __`RQ1.ipynb`__: 
	The notebook for the Research question 1.

2. __`RQ2.ipynb`__: 
	The notebook for the Research question 2.
  
3. __`final_dict`__: 
	A very important pickle file if you want to run the code. It contains the result of the BFS for every node of the input category, that required 2 hours of execution (you can avoid to do it again using this pickle file).

4. __`medians`__: 
	An other pickle file containing a dictionary of all medians to build the block_ranking.
